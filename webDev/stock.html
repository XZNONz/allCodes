        <h1>Stock</h1>
        <button>big</button>

        <p id="dis">In finance, stock (also capital stock) consists of the shares of which ownership of a corporation or
            company is
            divided.[1] (Especially in American English, the word "stocks" is also used to refer to shares.)[1][2] A
            single
            share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of
            shares.
            This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds
            from
            liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt),[3] or
            voting
            power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not all
            stock
            is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with
            enhanced
            voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other
            classes of shareholders.

            Stock can be bought and sold <a href="#nowhere">privately</a> or on stock exchanges, and such transactions
            are typically heavily
            regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are
            deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As new shares are
            issued
            by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or
            grow the business. Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial
            investment
            plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price. Stock options issued by many companies as part of
            employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time
            at a
            specified price. This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market
            price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the
            difference
            (minus taxes).</p>

        <p>A person who owns a percentage of the stock has the ownership of the corporation proportional to their share.
            The
            shares form a stock. The stock of a corporation is partitioned into shares, the total of which are stated at
            the
            time of business formation. Additional shares may subsequently be authorized by the existing shareholders
            and
            issued by the company. In some jurisdictions, each share of stock has a certain declared par value, which is
            a
            nominal accounting value used to represent the equity on the balance sheet of the corporation. In other
            jurisdictions, however, shares of stock may be issued without associated par value.

            Shares represent a fraction of ownership in a business. A business may declare different types (or classes)
            of
            shares, each having distinctive ownership rules, privileges, or share values. Ownership of shares may be
            documented by issuance of a stock certificate. A stock certificate is a legal document that specifies the
            number
            of shares owned by the shareholder, and other specifics of the shares, such as the par value, if any, or the
            class of the shares.

            In the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, and Australia, stock can also refer, less
            commonly, to
            all kinds of marketable securities.[4]</p>

        <p>Stock typically takes the form of shares of either common stock or preferred stock. As a unit of ownership,
            common stock typically carries voting rights that can be exercised in corporate decisions. Preferred stock
            differs from common stock in that it typically does not carry voting rights but is legally entitled to
            receive a
            certain level of dividend payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders.[5][6][page
            needed]
            Convertible preferred stock is preferred stock that includes an option for the holder to convert the
            preferred
            shares into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined date. Shares of such
            stock
            are called "convertible preferred shares" (or "convertible preference shares" in the UK).

            New equity issue may have specific legal clauses attached that differentiate them from previous issues of
            the
            issuer. Some shares of common stock may be issued without the typical voting rights, for instance, or some
            shares may have special rights unique to them and issued only to certain parties. Often, new issues that
            have
            not been registered with a securities governing body may be restricted from resale for certain periods of
            time.

            Preferred stock may be hybrid by having the qualities of bonds of fixed returns and common stock voting
            rights.
            They also have preference in the payment of dividends over common stock and also have been given preference
            at
            the time of liquidation over common stock. They have other features of accumulation in dividend. In
            addition,
            preferred stock usually comes with a letter designation at the end of the security; for example,
            Berkshire-Hathaway Class "B" shares sell under stock ticker BRK.B, whereas Class "A" shares of ORION DHC,
            Inc
            will sell under ticker OODHA until the company drops the "A" creating ticker OODH for its "Common" shares
            only
            designation. This extra letter does not mean that any exclusive rights exist for the shareholders but it
            does
            let investors know that the shares are considered for such, however, these rights or privileges may change
            based
            on the decisions made by the underlying company.</p>

        <h3>rule 144 stock <span class="syst">order</span></h3>
        <span>posted by <a href="3nowhere">/u/deezNutz</a></span>
        <p>"Rule 144 Stock" is an American term given to shares of stock subject to SEC Rule 144: Selling Restricted and
            Control Securities.[7] Under Rule 144, restricted and controlled securities are acquired in unregistered
            form.
            Investors either purchase or take ownership of these securities through private sales (or other means such
            as
            via ESOPs or in exchange for seed money) from the issuing company (as in the case with Restricted
            Securities) or
            from an affiliate of the issuer (as in the case with Control Securities). Investors wishing to sell these
            securities are subject to different rules than those selling traditional common or preferred stock. These
            individuals will only be allowed to liquidate their securities after meeting the specific conditions set
            forth
            by SEC Rule 144. Rule 144 allows public re-sale of restricted securities if a number of different conditions
            are
            met.</p>

        <p>The owners of a private company may want additional capital to invest in new projects within the company.
            They
            may also simply wish to reduce their holding, freeing up capital for their own private use. They can achieve
            these goals by selling shares in the company to the general public, through a sale on a stock exchange. This
            process is called an initial public offering, or IPO.

            By selling shares they can sell part or all of the company to many part-owners. The purchase of one share
            entitles the owner of that share to literally share in the ownership of the company, a fraction of the
            decision-making power, and potentially a fraction of the profits, which the company may issue as dividends.
            The
            owner may also inherit debt and even litigation.

            In the common case of a publicly traded corporation, where there may be thousands of shareholders, it is
            impractical to have all of them making the daily decisions required to run a company. Thus, the shareholders
            will use their shares as votes in the election of members of the board of directors of the company.

            In a typical case, each share constitutes one vote. Corporations may, however, issue different classes of
            shares, which may have different voting rights. Owning the majority of the shares allows other shareholders
            to
            be out-voted - effective control rests with the majority shareholder (or shareholders acting in concert). In
            this way the original owners of the company often still have control of the company.</p>

        <h3 class="syst">Shareholder Right</h3>
        <span>posted by <a href="3nowhere">/u/dimitri</a></span>
        <p>Although ownership of 50% of shares does result in 50% ownership of a company, it does not give the
            shareholder
            the right to use a company's building, equipment, materials, or other property. This is because the company
            is
            considered a legal person, thus it owns all its assets itself. This is important in areas such as insurance,
            which must be in the name of the company and not the main shareholder.

            In most countries, boards of directors and company managers have a fiduciary responsibility to run the
            company
            in the interests of its stockholders. Nonetheless, as Martin Whitman writes:

            ...it can safely be stated that there does not exist any publicly traded company where management works
            exclusively in the best interests of OPMI [Outside Passive Minority Investor] stockholders. Instead, there
            are
            both "communities of interest" and "conflicts of interest" between stockholders (principal) and management
            (agent). This conflict is referred to as the principal–agent problem. It would be naive to think that any
            management would forego management compensation, and management entrenchment, just because some of these
            management privileges might be perceived as giving rise to a conflict of interest with OPMIs.[21]
            Even though the board of directors runs the company, the shareholder has some impact on the company's
            policy, as
            the shareholders elect the board of directors. Each shareholder typically has a percentage of votes equal to
            the
            percentage of shares he or she owns. So as long as the shareholders agree that the management (agent) are
            performing poorly they can select a new board of directors which can then hire a new management team. In
            practice, however, genuinely contested board elections are rare. Board candidates are usually nominated by
            insiders or by the board of the directors themselves, and a considerable amount of stock is held or voted by
            insiders.

            Owning shares does not mean responsibility for liabilities. If a company goes broke and has to default on
            loans,
            the shareholders are not liable in any way. However, all money obtained by converting assets into cash will
            be
            used to repay loans and other debts first, so that shareholders cannot receive any money unless and until
            creditors have been paid (often the shareholders end up with nothing).[22]</p>
        <h3>means of financing</h3>
        <button>updoot!!</button>
        <button>updoot!!</button>
        <p>Financing a company through the sale of stock in a company is known as equity financing. Alternatively, debt
            financing (for example issuing bonds) can be done to avoid giving up shares of ownership of the company.
            Unofficial financing known as trade financing usually provides the major part of a company's working capital
            (day-to-day operational needs).</p>
